# Multi-Threaded Client/Server chat in Java
    About:
A multithreaded client/server Chat which uses Java Socket programming. A server listens for connection requests from clients across the network or from the same machine. Clients connect to the server by providing their IP address. After connecting to the server, the client gets to choose his/her username for the chat room.
The client sends a message, to server. After receiving the message from the client, the server broadcasts the message, if it's not a private message. If it's a private message, the client must provide a username of another online client and then the server will send the message only to that user. The socket is astblished vis port 45000.
